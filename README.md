# Dolphin and Whale Families Image Classification

In this repository you will find Jupyter Notebooks with Python code to build a model that will succesfully identify 5 cetacean families (families of whales and dolphins) with 70% accuracy. A description of each file and necessary dependencies is found in the Code subdirectory. 

You will also find a pdf of a Canva slideshow I used when presenting this project.
